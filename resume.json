I have a decent knowledge of Linux internals, networking, and system design. I work primarily with bare-metal and generic cloud services in all major providers, ones you consider safe from vendor locks like EC2 and S3. At that moment in my career, I'm a cloud builder, not a cloud user.<br />In recent years I have been programming mainly in Go, and you can find much of my work on my GitHub, https://github.com/paskal. Also, I can write code in Python, TypeScript and Shell and maintain and build upon code written in Ruby, Perl, PHP and Java.<br />I feel like a fish in a sea of high ambiguity and chaotic environments, where I need to figure out the goals and ways to reach them. I need a lot of responsibility and big problems on the horizon to be interested in my work.<br />I have three and a half years of team management experience, and I like leading more than managing, and I care a lot about mentoring and succeeding together. My peers consider me a good negotiator, and I have a history of finding working compromises for cross-team problems.",
