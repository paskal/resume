        "summary": "I have a passion for meaningful alerting and monitoring, troubleshooting, automation, and reliability. I have a decent knowledge of Linux internals, networking, and system design. I work primarily with bare-metal and generic cloud services in all major providers, ones you would consider safe from vendor-lock like EC2 and S3. In recent years I have been programming mainly in Go, and you can find much of my work in my GitHub, https://github.com/paskal. Also, I can write code in Python and Shell and maintain and build upon code written in Ruby, Perl, PHP and Java.<br />I feel like fish in a sea in the high ambiguity chaotic environments, where I need to figure out the goals and ways to reach them. I need a lot of responsibility and big problems on the horizon to be interested in my work.<br />I had three and a half years of team management experience and found that I like leading more than managing, and I care a lot about mentoring and succeeding together. My peers consider me a good negotiator, and I have a history of finding working compromises for cross-team problems.",
