    "summary": "My career began as a System Administrator for Biochemmack, where I helped this medical equipment dealer with technical support, server migration, autonomous work of local networks and servers, infrastructure modernization, and other areas. Then after a brief period in the Russian Army as a Squad Leader, I took a job as a Leading IT Department Specialist where I engaged in Virtualization, Linux, SQL, Java, as well as writing and revising of scripts in bash, perl, and python. This experience led me to IPONWEB where I am working as a Duty Operations Team Lead. I created monitoring with a human face, developed a team of seven, and got a recommendation. Overall, I have a lot of experience with building and improving monitoring systems, regular expressions, data processing, writing code in Python, using Mercurial, and Linux core utilities as well as web content distribution and popular balancing schemes. I also have 6 certifications, and in my free time, I’m learning Spanish. If you’d like to learn more about me, send me your inquiry at paskal.07@gmail.com",
