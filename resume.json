    "summary": "I'm passionate about creating systems that run smoothly with minimal human intervention. My focus is on setting up effective automation and alerts so that when problems arise, the right people are notified and equipped with the necessary information and action plans.<br />I excel in high-ambiguity environments where I need to figure out the goals and pathways to achieve them. While I've worked extensively with major cloud providers like AWS and GCP, I prefer using their basic services to avoid vendor lock-in and unnecessary complexity.<br />Contributing to open-source projects is particularly rewarding for me. I enjoy solving real-world problems for people who might not have the technical skills to do so themselves. I'm constantly pushing myself to learn and improve - for instance, I went from having no experience with technical interviewing to becoming one of the most experienced interviewers in my area within a year.<br />I'm particularly drawn to challenging projects where I can make a significant impact. My aim is to build robust, efficient systems that support a healthy work-life balance, allowing for standard working hours while accommodating those who wish to dedicate more time to their work.<br />In essence, I strive to create reliable, low-maintenance systems that empower rather than hinder their users and maintainers.",
